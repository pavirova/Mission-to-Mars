# Mission to Mars8

## Purpose
This project consisted of creating a web app through the use of Jupyter Notebook, Python, HTML scraping, MongoDB, BeautifulSoup, and Splinter. The app includes information on the planet mars, which was gathered through the use of existing webpages. DevTools were used to inspect the webpages we initially picked, then functions were written on a Python file, *scraping.py* to initialize data scraping. The *scraping.py* file was connected to the *app.py* file, where the flask application could run and connect to the Mongo database. Then, to add finishing touches to customize the web app, mobile responsiveness and different style options were added through the use of Bootstrap 3.
